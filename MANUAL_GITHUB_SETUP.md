## 🔧 Issue Encountered
The provided GitHub token doesn't have sufficient permissions to:
- Create repositories
- Push to the existing repository URL

## 📋 Manual Setup Required

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/Mayademe1020
2. Click "New repository" or go to https://github.com/new
3. Repository name: `yegebere-gebeya`
4. Description: `Ethiopian Livestock Platform - Comprehensive marketplace for farmers with digital barn management, veterinary services, and advanced analytics`
5. Set as **Public** repository
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Update Token Permissions
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Edit the existing token or create a new one
3. Ensure these permissions are selected:
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ **workflow** (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - ✅ **write:packages** (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)

### Step 3: Push Code to GitHub
Once the repository is created, run these commands:

```bash
cd /home/code/yegebere-gebeya

# Method 1: Using HTTPS with token
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Mayademe1020/yegebere-gebeya.git
git push -u origin main
# When prompted:
# Username: Mayademe1020
# Password: [your-updated-token-with-repo-permissions]

# Method 2: Using token in URL (alternative)
git push https://Mayademe1020:[your-token]@github.com/Mayademe1020/yegebere-gebeya.git main
```
